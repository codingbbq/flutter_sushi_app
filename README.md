# Flutter Sushi App

With this UI challenge, I try to do Live streams where I learn and understand the amazing world of Flutter.

In this live stream, we setup the flutter project and start working our way through the starter/landing page.

In this stream, we try to accomodate the gridView with the images on top. The height of each gridCell is fixed which causes a problem for expanding content. I need to figure out how expanding gridTile/gridCells work.

On 17th October 2020, I wanted to get the maximum of the weekend, so ended up doing 3 streams back to back in the entire day. Most of my time was spend figuring out how the customPaint widget worked and how to get the desired custom button for the order page.
